👋 I'm Calvin - and I like to code - a lot. I started my journey in November 2019 with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), then moved on to [Python](https://python.org) in June 2021, then to [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)/[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) in October 2023. I found out about jailbreaking in December 2022, and since then it just became my hobby. I'm not an expert (by a long shot) but I know my way around tech in general and just have fun playing around with it.

⚡ Some of my achivements include:
- 🎮 Recreating Hypixel Bedwars with only command blocks! *(this took me SEVEN months... worth it)*
- 🌉 Recreating Hypixel Bridge in ONE WEEK with only command blocks! (uploading the world downloads to github soon)
- 💾 Archiving a HUGE amount of AppleInt3rnal data and B1gB0ss packages
- 🏆 Winning a game of Bedwars on a USB drive.
This is not much, but I'm trying to do some more. 

🧠 What am I doing now?
- 🔭 Right now I'm archiving Apple1nt3rnal software and r1pb1gb0ss, because you never know when the next biggest repo will go down ([modmyi](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sad-day-for-jailbreakers-modmyi-and-zodttd-macciti-cydia-repositories-shut-down.2090898/)). I'm also working on my own [website](https://cc7623.github.io), and overall a bunch of stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about scratch, python, HTML, and iOS.

I try to know as much as I can, and I'm always learning new things every day.
