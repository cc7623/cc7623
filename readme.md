I started my journey in November 2019 with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), then moved on to [Python](https://python.org) in June 2021, then to [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)/[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) in October 2023. I found out about jailbreaking in December 2022, and since then it just became my hobby. I'm not an expert, by a long shot, but I know my way around tech in general and I have fun playing around with it.

⚡ Some projects from the past:
- 💽 Recreating Hypixel Bedwars with only command blocks
- 🏹 Recreating Hypixel Bridge with only command blocks *(uploading the world downloads to github soon)*
- 💾 Archiving a HUGE amount of AppleInt3rnal data and B1gB0ss packages
- 🏆 Winning a game of bedwars on a USB drive

🧠 What am I doing now?
- 🔭 Right now I'm archiving Apple1nt3rnal software and B1gB0ss archives, because you never know when the next biggest repo will go down (`going to modmyi.com now redirects to techradar, and it doesn't look like modmyi's going to come back online. unfortunately, this has lost many tweaks from the internet. RIP modmyi: 2008-2023. you will be missed.`). I'm also working on my own [website](https://cc7623.github.io), and overall a bunch of stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about scratch, python, HTML, and iOS.

I try to know as much as I can, and I'm always learning new things every day.
