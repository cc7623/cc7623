I started my journey in November 2019 with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), then moved on to [Python](https://python.org) in June 2021, then to [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)/[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) in October 2023. I found out about jailbreaking in December 2022, and since then it just became my hobby. I'm not an expert, by a long shot, but I know my way around tech in general and I have fun playing around with it.

⚡ Some projects from/for the past, present, and future:
- 💽 Recreated Hypixel Bedwars with only command blocks
- 🏹 Recreated Hypixel Bridge with only command blocks *(uploading the world downloads to github soon. it's been over 1 yr, I should really get to that.)*
- 💾 Archiving a HUGE amount of [AppleInt3rnal](https://github.com/cc7623/appleintcollection) data and [B1gB0ss files](https://github.com/cc7623/b1gb0ss-arch1ve)
- 🌐 Making my own website ([cc7623.github.io](https://cc7623.github.io))
- 📶 Making a guide on school WiFi and how to bypass [cc7623.github.io/evade.github.io](https://cc7623.github.io/evade.github.io)
- 🕒 And much more that I'll probably never get to.

I try to know as much as I can, and I'm always learning new things every day.
