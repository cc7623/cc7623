I'm Calvin - and I like to code - a lot. I started my journey in November 2019 with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), then moved on to [Python](https://python.org), then to [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)/[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS). I found out about jailbreaking in December 2022, and since then it just became my hobby. I'm not an expert (by a long shot) but I know my way around tech in general and just have fun playing around with it.

🧠 What am I doing?
- 🔭 I'm currently working on archiving a bunch of stuff. Right now I'm doing Apple1nt3rnal software and r1pb1gb0ss, because you never know when the next biggest repo will go down ([modmyi](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sad-day-for-jailbreakers-modmyi-and-zodttd-macciti-cydia-repositories-shut-down.2090898/)).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about scratch, python, HTML, and jailbreaking. I try to expand my knowledge on all subjects.


📫 How do you reach me?
- 💬 You can contact me at yt.calvin.coolest@gmail.com.


I try to know as much as I can, and I'm always learning new things every day.
